#1. Read in data "class_7.csv"
 
#2. Regress births on income. 
 
#3. Plot your residuals against income
 
#4. Plot your residuals against time
 
#5. Test for AR(1) errors by using the residuals from your regression (regress residual on its lag)
 
#6. Follow the steps in the slides on calculating the FGLS estimator. 
 
  
# - Estimate the original (untransformed) model; save residuals.
# - Estimate œÅ Regress residuals on their lags (no intercept).
# - Estimate the transformed model (look at formula on slide 29 )
