# # Plot histogram but restrict x-axis to [-25, 25]
# g_trim <- g[abs(g) <= 7]
# hist(g_trim,  xlim = c(-7, 7), breaks=50,
#      main = "Sample mean of Cauchy(0,1)",

#      col = "lightblue", border = "white")
# 
# # Add a vertical line at 0 for reference
# abline(v = 0, col = "red", lwd = 2)
# 
#  # Another (more obvious) are small samples from a bimodal distribution (where the mean bounces around). 
# rm(list = ls()) # clear memory
# set.seed(123)
# mixpop <- c(rnorm(5e5, -5, 1), rnorm(5e5, 5, 1))
